\textbf{\textcolor{Rblue}{Overview:}} \\

I am very pleased you will be participating in the \emph{The Sport
  Statistician's Toolbox} workshop. The workshop will cover a number
of skills and statistical models that are common in sports
statistics and show how each can be implemented in
\textcolor{Rblue}{\bfseries R}. The workshop will introduce
participants to a range of
\textcolor{Rblue}{\bfseries R} packages and real sports examples will
be used throughout. It will be very hands-on! \\

After completing this workshop, participants will be able to gather
and clean public sports data more effectively, explore data with
graphics, apply several common models used in sport, and share their
sports statistics ideas through a blog. \\

A brief outline of the workshop is given below. Further details and
instructions will be sent to participants prior to the conference.
