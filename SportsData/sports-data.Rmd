# Box Scores

A 'box score' is a generic term for the summary statistics reported about a single sporting event.

.hbox[
This is the most abundant type of sports data and the easiest to get your hands on.

# Metrics

A lot of sports data is pre-summarized or the output of a statistical model that is used for further analysis. There are <i>derived</i> sports data.

- Game predictions

- Player ratings

- Betting odds

.hbox[
Metrics are most available for sports where the most statistical work is going on.

# Getting Data

Here are some resources to directly download large amounts of sports data for free:

<br>

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  Resource = c("Open Source Sports", "Massey Ratings", "Washington Post", "Retrosheet", "Sean Lahman's Database"),
  Site = c("www.opensourcesports.com", "www.masseyratings.com/data.php", "stats.washingtonpost.com/cbk/teams.asp", "www.retrosheet.org/", "www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics"),
  `Types of Data` = c("American team sports", "American Pro and collegiate sports", "Collegiate basketball", "Major league baseball", "Major league baseball")
)

cols <- c( "#fff", "#eeeeee")

htmlTable(data, 
          rnames = F, 
          col.rgroup = cols,
          css.cell = "text-align:left;")
```

# Packages

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  Sport = c("General", "", "", "Soccer", "Baseball", "", "Tennis", "Cricket"),
  Package = c("stattleshipR", "SportsAnalytics", "odds.converter",  "engsoccerdata", "pitchRx", "Lahman", "deuce", "cricketr!"),
  `What They Do` = c("Extract data for major American sports", "Historical soccer data", "Conversion functions for many types of odds", "Historical soccer data", "Scrape and visualize MLB gameday and pitch tracking data", "Historical baseball data", "Historical tennis data",  "Historical data and analytic tools for cricket")
)

cols <- c( "#fff", "#fff", "#fff", "#eeeeee", "#fff", "#fff", "#eeeeee", "#fff")

htmlTable(data, 
          rnames = F, 
          col.rgroup = cols,
          css.cell = "text-align:left;")
```

# Reality Check

For answering topical questions for our sport of interest, we will usually need to scrape data from the Web. 


That is the focus of the next part of the workshop...
